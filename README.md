# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

software engineering applys engineering principles in order to develop and maintain high quality software system, itt involves product design, development,testing, deployment and maintenance.
it is important because it enables the creation of software systems and applications that powers many aspects of life. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
development of c
development of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
structured programming

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
requirement has to do with the gathering of information such as user needs and system requirements
design creation of high level and detalied design for the software architecture and user interface 
implemantation writing code and building the software according to the design specifications
testing conducting tests to meet software quality standards and functional rquirements
deployment - releasing the software to users
maintenance - providing ongoing support and updates

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall is a sequential approach with different phases, low flexibility
agile is a iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility and collaboration, high flexibility,

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
 A software developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
 A quality assurance engineer is responsible for ensuring quality by designing and executing test plans
 a project manager oversses the planning, execution and delivery of software products

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments- provides comprehensive tools for writting, debugging and testing code e.g Visual studio

Version control system are important because they allow collaboration between teams and tracking changes to source code e.g git, github

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
the challenges are tight deadlines, changing requirements and technical debt, the strategies to overcome them are effective communication, agile methodies, and prioritization of tasks.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Importance of Testing: Testing is a critical aspect of QA and involves various types of testing, including:
  Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
  Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
  System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
  Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is creating the best possible question to get the best possible answer from AI, the question must be clear and concise.

it is important because it helps AI gives the best possible answer, helps avoid vague questions and answers.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
